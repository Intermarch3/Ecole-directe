# Hello ðŸ‘‹

##### Here is my python program which uses the private API of ecole direct

It allows you to recover:
 - your homeworks
    - of today
    - to come up
    - of a specific day
 - your course schedule
    - of today
    - of the week
    - of a specific date
 - your grades per periodes
    - averages (min, max, ...)
    - all grades

## Launch

#### 1) Download the project

#### 2) Lauch it on the terminal : `python main.py`

#### And that's it, the program is running ðŸŽ‰

### If requests doesnt work, check if the APIVERSION is up to date (look on ecole direct requests)  
## Help/contact
If you want to help me in this project or report me a bug, don't hesitate.

### âš  As I am no longer a high school student, i no longer have access to ecole direct so i can't improve it anymore.
